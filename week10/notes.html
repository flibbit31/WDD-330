            Two types of client-side validation:
            Built-in form validation and JavaScript validation
            Valid form elements have the :valid CSS pseudo-class, otherwise :invalid.
            Indicate to the users what fields are required.
            Pattern attribute for regexps.
            Constraint Validation API uses JavaScript.
            ValidityState Object properties: patternMismatch, tooLong, tooShort, rangeOverflow, rangeUnderflow, typeMismatch, valid, valueMissing, willValidate.
            setCustomValidity() set’s a custom error message.
            reportValidity() will set input as invalid if the input is invalid so that the form can’t submit.
            Use form novalidate to prevent HTML automatic validation.
            You can do validation without the constraint validation API or use Validate.js.

            Document 2: Fetch API:
            Response.json() returns another Promise.
            Credentials: ‘include’ causes the browser to send credentials in the request.
            Put the data you want to send in the body: of a POST or PUT request.
            Response.body.getReader();
            Check if the response was successful with response.ok
            Reading a cloned response or request with not cause the original to be marked as read.
            You can add, edit, get, and delete parts of a Headers object. This can be used to check if a certain type of data has truly been returned by the server.
            You can create your own Request and Response objects.
            Request and Response methods: arrayBuffer(), blob(), formData(), json(), text().
