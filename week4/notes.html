            Const form = document.forms[‘search’];
            The blur event occurs when an element loses focus.
            The change event occurs when a user changes a field and then it loses focus.
            Use event.preventDefault() to stop a submit button from submitting a form.
            The placeholder attribute in html can add placeholder text to an input field.
            Use type=’text’ when you intend for something to be a text field, even though it isn’t required.
            Put the input tag inside the label tag.
            If several elements in a form have the same name attribute, they can all be accessed using form.[insert name here];
            Automatically check a box with the checked attribute in html.
            All radio buttons in a set must have the same name attribute.
            Use form.[radio buttons name].value to find the selected radio button’s value.
            Remember that hidden and file input fields are available.
            Use the selected attribute in html to automatically select an option from a drop-down list.
            form[select name].selectedIndex returns the index of the selected option.
            You can put text in a textarea by putting text between opening and closing textarea tags.
            Buttons don’t have to be inside a form.
            Use both client-side and server-side validation.
            You can put a keyup listener on an input element to validate input as it is being entered.
            Use the disabled attribute to disable a submit button.

            Ch 12:
            Prototype based languages use objects(prototypes) as a basic for creating other objects.
            Use literals to create arrays.
            const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10); would create an object with the same type as the redDice object.
            The prototype allows you to add methods and property values to all instances of a class through instances inheriting from the prototype.
            Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype. (Though you can set default values in constructors in a class declaration.
            What does the book mean when it says that all prototype chains end at the Object() contructor function?
            Monkey-patching involves adding methods and properties to built in objects, which is discouraged. You can instead create a subclass to extend the functionality.
            To create an object based on another object, use Object.create(object);
            Return this if a method doesn’t need to return anything else.
            Use bind(this) so that nested functions using “this” will refer to the object that called the outer function.
            To borrow a method, use banana = Gorilla.prototype.banana;
            Then, banana.call(object, arguments);
            Use export, default export, and import for module functionality.
