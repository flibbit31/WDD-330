            Ch 9: 
            Only browser environments have a window object.
            Global variables and functions are members of the window object (or global object in other environments).
            Alert(), confirm, and prompt() all pause the program.
            Alert() displays an alert, prompt displays the same, but with ok and cancel buttons, and prompt displays a message with an input box.
            Window.navigator.userAgent is unreliable.
            Window.location has information about the current page(URL). You can use this to redirect to another page.
            Window.location.reload() will reload the current page.
            Window.history shows previously visted pages in the current browser session.
            Window.history.go(1) goes forward 1 page and window.history.go(-1) goes back one page.
            “const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','
            SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');” opens a new window and stores a reference to it in “popup”.
            Popup.close() closes the window.
            These methods can be annoying, so be cautious.
            Window.screen for resolution and color depth information.
            “Cookies can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them.”
            Document.cookie = “hero=true”; creates a new cookie value.
            Document.cookie = “hero=false”; updates the hero value.
            Split up cookie values in a cookie with const cookieArray = document.cookie.split(“; “);
            By default, cookies are deleted at the end of a session. To change this:
            Document.cookie = `name=Batman; expires=${ expiryDate.toUTCString()}`; where expiryDate is a Date object.
            Cookies with sensitive information shouldn’t rely on cookie expiry working properly. It doesn’t always work properly.
            Document.cookie = ‘name=Batman; path=/’ will allow everything in the domain to access the cookie.
            Delete a cookie by setting it’s expiration to a time in the past.
            Try a library like Cookies.js or jsCookie for cookie handling.
            setTimeout() allows you to call a method at regular intervals.
            setInterval() does the same thing but repeats the method.
            requestAnimationFrame(animationFunction()) is more efficient.
            Use cancelAnimationFrame() to stop an animation.
            Generally use CSS for animation instead of JavaScript.

            Ch 14:
            Data- attributes can’t be used by external pages.
            Data-max-length in HTML is accessed with dataset.maxLength in JavaScript.
            Use feature detection before using API methods.
            sessionStorage works like localStorage, but only stores something for one browser session.
            getItem and setItem, as well as localStorage.name can be used.
            removeItem() exists too.
            Clear() deletes everything in localStorage.
            Navigator.geolocation.getcurrentPosition(youAreHere); passes the user’s location to the youAreHere function.
            You can get the accuracy of a position too.
            Worker scripts:
            Const worker = new Worker(‘task.js’);
            Worker.postMessage(‘Hello’); message from main script to worker script.
            Self.postMessage(‘Finished’); message from worker script to main script.
            Worker.addEventListener(‘message’, (event) => {
            }, false); listen for messages from the worker.
            Worker.terminate(); terminate worker.
            Self.close(); terminate worker.
            If(window.Worker) { } checks if web workers are supported.
            Event.data has the data from the worker message.
            Messages between the main script and worker script are strings?
            Shared web workers can be accessed by any script in the domain.
            Look into the service worker API.
            WebSockets:
            To create a WebSocket (two way communication instead of request and response) use const connection = new WebSocket(URL);
            Connection.addEventListener(‘open’, functionToCallWhenConnected, false);
            Send to a server with connection.send(message);
            Listen for messages from the server with connection.AddEventListener(‘message’, (event) => {
                Console.log(event.data);
            }, false);
            Connections can listen for “close” and “error” events too.
            If(window.Notificatioin) {
                Notification.requestPermission() to set up notifications with the user’s OS.
            Const notification = new Notification(Title, { body:, icon: });
            You can listen to click, show, and close events on the notification created.
            Use audio and video tags for audio and video. Src points to the video or audio, and the controls attributes attaches controls(play, pause, etc) to the video or audio.
            The video or audio can be controlled in Javascript by getting it using the DOM.
            Use video.addEventListener(‘loadmetadata’, videoFunctions); to make sure that the video has loaded before checking it’s properties.
            Canvas:
            Get 2D context with canvas.getContext(‘2d’);
            Context.lineWidth exists.
            Context.fillRect() and context.strokeRect()
            Use context.beginPath() to draw lines and arcs.
            Use context.fillText(text, x, y); for drawing text.
            Use shims and polyfills for users with older browsers.
