            I’ll use VS code
            Course has explorations and projects
            Course is in two blocks, each with reading and then programming challenges
            At the end of challenges, I can ask the instructor to evaluate me.
            My portfolio and evaluation of myself will determine my grade.
            How does the position attribute work again?

            The section tag fills in an entire horizontal line of the webpage.
            += appends numbers and text
            What does input:focus mean?
            What does the : mean in regards to css attributes?

            Mobile First UX (User Experience):
            Design should be focused on the least powerful device.
            PC: Replaced every 4-5 yrs
            Mobile: Replaced every 2 yrs.
            There are getting to be more devices in each household.
            Do mobile first or make mobile friendly if you already have a desktop site and don’t have the money to rewrite the website.
            Start small and scale up.
            Mobile is not a fad.
            “…people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”
            Be there, Be useful, Be quick (To many clicks or taps).
            Immediate. Relevant. Frictionless.
            Keep in mind how people hold the device when determining where buttons are.
            Fast loading = more traffic and more revenue. 
            Some people have slower speeds.
            To increase speed: Reduce image use, SVG/Webfonts are faster, Optimize and minify css and js file size. (remove white space), Use GZIP files.
            Primary controls should go at the bottom of the screen (more reachable).
            The three lines on top of one another is not understood my everyone. Instead, use a button with a border labeled “Menu”.
            Don’t ask for unnecessary information in forms. Put the label for an input field as a suggestion inside the field. 
            Make the fields big enough for users to click on easily. When a user clicks on the field, the label should go to the top of the field. Use big checkboxes. 
            Break big forms into separate sections with a progress indicator.
            Enable autocomplete on forms.
            Show password by default but allow them to hide it if necessary.
            Auto format credit card information and auto advance to the next credit card field.
            Use the right virtual keyboard for the information that is needed. Credit card field should bring up a numbers-only keyboard.
            Make phone numbers a link so that they call by just clicking it.
            Research how users use things before advertising.
            Popup advertisements that cover up content is bad.
            Advertisements that require you to scroll down for the content are also annoying and bad.
            Keep ads simple, small, and unobtrusive that are expanded when they are clicked.
            Video ads are effective too.
            “STOP USING POP-UPS/POP-OVERS”.
            Content is the biggest priority over ads.
